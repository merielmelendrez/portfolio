                A paradigm consists of a community’s ideals, observations, and practices. 
                It contributes to a collective sense of reality and undergirds how the community organizes itself. 
                A paradigm of interdependence—what Kriti Sharma calls radical contingency, 
                Fritjof Capra calls the systems view of life, and I playfully rename living al amor de la vida— is 
                coalescing in the global community. Below, I offer a translation of my phrase and a colloquial bibliography, 
                outlining this cosmopolitan sense of connectivity. <br /><br />



Vivir al amor de la vida is a slang Spanish neologism based on two idioms.<br /><br />


1. Estar al amor de la lumbre  “to be at the love of the flame” means to be close to the fire—typically a hearth or a bonfire.<br /><br />
2.Ir al amor del agua “to go to the love of the water” means to go with the current, the flow.<br /><br />
3. What might vivir al amor de la vida mean? To “live to the love of the life”?<br /><br />
I suggest that “al amor de” can indicate a copacetic relationship with the generous, 
perhaps wild nature of something, something such as fire, water, or life. Happily warm. 
Not fighting. In harmony. Moreover, since we humans are ~60% water, 
utilize a poetic kind of fire—oxygen-based metabolism that resembles combustion—within our cells, 
and are very much alive; in all three of these cases, the relationship in “al amor de” includes being another form of that generous wild.<br /><br />
            
                Bibliography <br /><br />
                The influences are listed in loose chronological order of their primary innovation. 
                An asterix (*) indicates a major shift from an oral to a written tradition. 
                These teachings their teachers hail from all over the Earth; they often converge with or influence each other. 
                For now, I list the teachers from whom I have learned the most and omit many. <br /><br />

                Living organisms are all kin related; they often enter into mutually caring relationships with one another; 
                land masses are materially dynamic and teem with living organisms; 
                and the metabolic processes of living organisms can affect the life-sustaining character of the local and 
                global environments. Evolution, symbiosis, ecology, Gaia; western science; Charles Darwin, Lynn Margulis,

                The “births and deaths” of stars generate materials and habitable conditions for life;
