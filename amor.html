                In loose chronological order of their primary mutation, my core influences and influencers are listed below. An asterix (*) indicates a large shift from an oral to a written tradition. 
                These teachings and teachers hail from all over the Earth and sometimes converge or influence each other. <br /> <br />
 

The principle that organisms and earth formations are family members to care for and who give care in return. 
Kincentricity; indigenous ecology*; Robin Wall Kimmerer, Enrique Salmón. <br />

A cultivated feeling of caring love toward all sentient beings that leads to devotion to their/our wellbeing. 
Metta and bodhicitta; Buddhism*; The Buddha, The Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hahn. <br />

Vast, loving forgiveness. This kind of grace seems needed sometimes. Mercy; Christianity*; Christ. <br />

The principles that living organisms are all kin related; 
that they often enter into mutually caring relationships with one another; 
that land masses are teeming with living organisms; 
and that the metabolic processes of living organisms can affect the life-sustaining character 
of the local and global environments. 
Evolution, symbiosis, ecology, Gaia; western science; Charles Darwin, Lynn Margulis, James Lovelock.<br />

An innate affinity for living beings. Biophilia; western science; E.O. Wilson. <br />

That all living beings have merit and actions should be taken for their benefit. 
Deep ecology; western spirituality and science; Arnae Nass. <br />

Sensually vibrant, equitable, caring relationships might pervade society, politics and economy. The erotic; feminism; Audrey Lorde. <br />


Linguistic note: <br />
Love of life is more typically translated into Spanish as amor por la vida, love for life, and often used to mean love for one’s lifestyle. “Al amor de la vida” is an ambiguous neologism based on idioms.<br/>
When I estoy al amor de la lumbre, I am close to the fire—a hearth or bonfire. When I voy al amor del agua, I go with the current: I’m in the love made between the water and the terrain or a weather cycle. (If humans could swim as well as salmon, maybe el amor del agua would mean against the currents, too!) “Al amor de” can indicate a copacetic relationship with the generous, perhaps wild nature of something. A couple of examples that don’t use “al” El amor de madre is mother love. El amor de Díos is love from God. Moreover, we humans are 60% water, carry a poetic kind of fire—oxygen based metabolism that resembles combustion—within our cells, and are very much alive. To go al amor de something in all these instances is to be another form of it.
