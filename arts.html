                  I’ve used floral arranging to express care for people, and to connect them to the landscape. A lot of plants seem to appreciate the pruning and propagating, too.</p>

                <p>As part of nearly every garden care visit, I gathered a bouquet of flowers for the client. 
                I used the greenery, flowers, and vases on hand and eschewed industry-standard equipment such as floral-foam and tape that ease designing but leave plastic and microplastic debris. These freely structured bouquets prompted many clients to exclaim with surprise and delight: “Did that come out of my yard?” Floral arrangements distilled the garden, its seasonality and abundance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  I arranged foraged materials for two family weddings, and for Provisions, a local-source restaurant in Vallejo. 
                  One gardening client repeatedly expressed worry that my floral craft would become lucrative, supercede my gardening business, 
                  and I would stop gardening for her. I haven’t yet taken flowers so far.

                    An enthusiastic doodler, I've earned a minor award in political cartooning, a research apprenticeship in scientific illustration, and a spot in Vallejo's Art Window Project, pictured above. 
                    I made the outline for that four-foot long painting of a salmon with masking tape and primer, then invited visitors at the Vallejo Ranger Station to paint in a collage of what brings them joy in nature. 
                    The youngest participant was two. Everyone signed their names and we peeled off the tape. The salmon is one of a quartet from that project.

                    I have a variegated history with capturing light for display via cameras.</p>
                  <p>Sebastio Salgado was my photography hero as a teen so I took to the darkroom to learn to make silver-glycee prints. The photo below from that phase won the county high school photojournalism award. I went through a few phases after that.</p>

                  />
                    <p>Under the tutelage of photographer and architect Jean Paul Bourdier at UC Berkeley, I took a few fairly experimental photographs of my friends, some now-fairly prominent women, 
                    that we might some day decide to release. 

                    I became proficient at microscopy photography while researching redwood pores. 
                    I’ve held one photography show, where I used to waitress, at which I sold several landscapes encased in frames that I made by hand out of driftwood. 
                    After that, I accepted a gig photodocumenting a research team in South Africa in 2014.

                  <p>  
                    Eventually, not in the mood for post-processing, I settled into to a quiet, semi-private life on Instagram for several years, 
                    shooting exclusively with an iPhone 4 or SE which I selected for the diminuative, durable case size rather than camera quality, plus a jewler's loupe for a macro lens. That collection includes most of the photos on this website. I recently made this account public and you can follow me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/merielmelendrezmees/" target="blank" id="external">@merielmelendrezmees</a>.

                      A passion for dance suddenly struck in my late teens. 
                      This joy opened up invitational roles to dance
                       in the first Visions of the Wild Festival variety show,
                       dance and act in the San Francisco Poet’s Experimental Theater, 
                       and act in the independent film <i>Precarious</i>. <i>Precarious</i> has been translated into four languages and won ten awards.
