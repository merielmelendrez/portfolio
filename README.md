##Credits

-Homepage portrait: [Mark Katz](http://tracestructures.com/)

-I gained some design inspiration, particularly the use of detail and summary tags, from the example solution on Codecademy: [A personal website for Ada Lovelace](https://priceless-kepler-06d70c.netlify.app/)

-The dropdown version of the navigation bar: [Kim T](https://medium.com/creative-technology-concepts-code/responsive-mobile-dropdown-navigation-using-css-only-7218e4498a99). If you notice a way to fix my bug at around 800px wide, the width of an iPad in portrait orientation, would you please let me know? I solved one local problem by changing the display to flex and created another!
